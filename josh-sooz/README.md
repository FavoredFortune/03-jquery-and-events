# Kilovolt Blog - Lab 03

**Author**: Josh West and Suzanne Richman

**Version**: 1.0.6 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

**UPDATES** 1.0.6 was completed by Suzanne Richman alone

## Overview

We want users to be able to read content easily on mobile and desktop browsers while selecting content by author or catagory, if desired and to view the blog as a multipage site (despite actually being a single page).


## Getting Started

The user would need to 
* Create index.html
* Get the icons from IcoMoon
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats
* Add filler text
* Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN)
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructorâ€™s method
* Use jQuery to access and clone HTML elements of the DOM and populate those elements with content from the article array
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM
* Create an array of objects to hold the content generation for the DOM for each object.
* Create a JS file to generate a more interactive view of the DOM (selecting authors, catagories and hiding/showing full articles as well as navigating the long page as if it was a multipage website).

## Architecture

We used IcoMoon icon font for navigation icons. We included the jQuery library. We used Chrome to analyze and inspect. Project is built on HTML, CSS,and JavaScript.
